# Campus Navigator

Campus Navigator is a real-time GPS navigation system built specifically for RVCE campus. It integrates location-based services with a rule-based AIML chatbot to help students and visitors find their way around campus. The system features turn-by-turn navigation with visual building recognition, popular location tracking, and a campus information assistant.

The project uses React.js with Leaflet maps for the frontend, Flask with MongoDB for the backend, and AIML for the chatbot component. Location data was manually collected by recording precise GPS coordinates of campus buildings, alongside photographs for visual confirmation. The navigation system provides real-time speed tracking, route estimation, and direction guidance with custom markers, while the AIML chatbot offers information about building locations, facility hours, and campus amenities through pattern matching and predefined responses.
